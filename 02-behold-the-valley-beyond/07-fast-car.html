          <p>You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we can make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we&#39;ll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won&#39;t have to drive too far
Just &#39;cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
See, my old man&#39;s got a problem
He live with the bottle, that&#39;s the way it is
He say his body&#39;s too old for working
His body&#39;s too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody&#39;s got to take care of him
So I quit school and that&#39;s what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped &#39;round my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain&#39;t got a job
And I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You&#39;ll find work and I&#39;ll get promoted
And we&#39;ll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped &#39;round my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I&#39;d always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me&#39;d find it
I got no plans, I ain&#39;t going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped &#39;round my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way</p>
