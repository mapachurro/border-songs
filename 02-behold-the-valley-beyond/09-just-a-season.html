<p>If all my days was hills to climb and circles without reason
If all I was was passing time, my life was just a season</p>
<p>Dares and dreams and silly schemes and fillies running freely
I was young and no song was sung that didn&#39;t sound appealing
I&#39;d have my fun with a shy girl and maybe hop a train
And I&#39;d look back at her standing in the rain</p>
<p>Dirty hands and root beer stands and money like a river
Making deals to see how it feels to get more than you&#39;re giving
I&#39;d have my fun with a gamblin&#39; man and bluff him with my face
And it&#39;s drinks for everybody in the place</p>
<p>If all my days was hills to climb and circles without reason
If all I was was passing time my life was just a season
If all my days was hills to climb and circles without reason
If all I was was passing time my life was just a season</p>
<p>Shouting crowds and mummer&#39;s shrouds and people going crazy
Always said what was in their heads it surely was amazing
I had my fun in the bull ring and never got a scar
It really wasn&#39;t hard to be a star</p>
<p>If all my days was hills to climb and circles without reason
If all I was was passing time my life was just a season</p>
