          <p>Early one mornin’ the sun was shinin’  </p>
<p>I was layin’ in bed  </p>
<p>Wond’rin’ if she’d changed at all  </p>
<p>If her hair was still red  </p>
<p>Her folks they said our lives together  </p>
<p>Sure was gonna be rough  </p>
<p>They never did like Mama’s homemade dress  </p>
<p>Papa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough  </p>
<p>And I was standin’ on the side of the road  </p>
<p>Rain fallin’ on my shoes  </p>
<p>Heading out for the East Coast  </p>
<p>Lord knows I’ve paid some dues gettin’ through  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue  </p>
<p>She was married when we first met  </p>
<p>Soon to be divorced  </p>
<p>I helped her out of a jam, I guess  </p>
<p>But I used a little too much force  </p>
<p>We drove that car as far as we could  </p>
<p>Abandoned it out West  </p>
<p>Split up on a dark sad night  </p>
<p>Both agreeing it was best  </p>
<p>She turned around to look at me  </p>
<p>As I was walkin’ away  </p>
<p>I heard her say over my shoulder  </p>
<p>“We’ll meet again someday on the avenue”  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue  </p>
<p>I had a job in the great north woods  </p>
<p>Working as a cook for a spell  </p>
<p>But I never did like it all that much  </p>
<p>And one day the ax just fell  </p>
<p>So I drifted down to New Orleans  </p>
<p>Where I happened to be employed  </p>
<p>Workin’ for a while on a fishin’ boat  </p>
<p>Right outside of Delacroix  </p>
<p>But all the while I was alone  </p>
<p>The past was close behind  </p>
<p>I seen a lot of women  </p>
<p>But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue  </p>
<p>She was workin’ in a topless place  </p>
<p>And I stopped in for a beer  </p>
<p>I just kept lookin’ at the side of her face  </p>
<p>In the spotlight so clear  </p>
<p>And later on as the crowd thinned out  </p>
<p>I’s just about to do the same  </p>
<p>She was standing there in back of my chair  </p>
<p>Said to me, “Don’t I know your name?”  </p>
<p>I muttered somethin’ underneath my breath  </p>
<p>She studied the lines on my face  </p>
<p>I must admit I felt a little uneasy  </p>
<p>When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue  </p>
<p>She lit a burner on the stove  </p>
<p>And offered me a pipe  </p>
<p>“I thought you’d never say hello,” she said  </p>
<p>“You look like the silent type”  </p>
<p>Then she opened up a book of poems  </p>
<p>And handed it to me  </p>
<p>Written by an Italian poet  </p>
<p>From the thirteenth century  </p>
<p>And every one of them words rang true  </p>
<p>And glowed like burnin’ coal  </p>
<p>Pourin’ off of every page  </p>
<p>Like it was written in my soul from me to you  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue  </p>
<p>I lived with them on Montague Street  </p>
<p>In a basement down the stairs  </p>
<p>There was music in the cafés at night  </p>
<p>And revolution in the air  </p>
<p>Then he started into dealing with slaves  </p>
<p>And something inside of him died  </p>
<p>She had to sell everything she owned  </p>
<p>And froze up inside  </p>
<p>And when finally the bottom fell out  </p>
<p>I became withdrawn  </p>
<p>The only thing I knew how to do  </p>
<p>Was to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue  </p>
<p>So now I’m goin’ back again  </p>
<p>I got to get to her somehow  </p>
<p>All the people we used to know  </p>
<p>They’re an illusion to me now  </p>
<p>Some are mathematicians  </p>
<p>Some are carpenters’ wives  </p>
<p>Don’t know how it all got started  </p>
<p>I don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives  </p>
<p>But me, I’m still on the road  </p>
<p>Headin’ for another joint  </p>
<p>We always did feel the same  </p>
<p>We just saw it from a different point of view  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue</p>

        <h2>Commentary & Notes</h2>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>The video linked in this article is not to the album version. Dylan notably played with the lyrics of this song, probably partially because he was unsatisfied with the direction and feel of where his art was going at the time; the performance from the Rolling Thunder Revue, linked here, is of particular interest.</p>
<p>He was playing with Emmy Lou Harris and Roger McGuinn on this tour; the name of the tour was an explicit reference to the Nixon-era carpetbombing of Laos; his performances of &#39;Hurricane&#39; on this tour were passionate, and simultaneously carried on his reputation of &quot;protest songs&quot;, despite that being clearly something he felt he was trying to get rid of.</p>
<p>Point being: this tour, in some ways, was maybe the last concerted effort to play Cosmic American Music, as such.</p>
