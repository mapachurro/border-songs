          <p>Early one mornin’ the sun was shinin’<br>She was lyin’ in bed<br>Wond’rin’ if she’d changed at all<br>If her hair was still red  </p>
<p>Her folks they said our lives together<br>Sure was gonna be rough<br>They never did like Mama’s homemade dress<br>Papa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough  </p>
<p>He was standin’ on the side of the road<br>Rain fallin’ on his shoes<br>Heading out for the East Coast<br>Lord knows he&#39;d paid some dues gettin’ through  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue  </p>
<p>She was married when they first met<br>Soon to be divorced<br>He helped her out of a jam, I guess<br>But he used a little too much force  </p>
<p>And they drove that car as far as they could<br>Abandoned it out West<br>Splitting up on a dark sad night<br>Both agreeing it was best  </p>
<p>She turned around to look at him<br>As he was walkin’ away<br>Saying over her shoulder<br>“We’ll meet again someday on the avenue”  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue  </p>
<p>He had a job in Santa Fe<br>Working in an old hotel<br>But he never did like it all that much<br>And one day it just went to hell  </p>
<p>So he drifted down to New Orleans<br>Lucky not to be destroyed<br>Where he got him a job on a fishin’ boat<br>Docked outside Delacroix  </p>
<p>But all the while he was alone<br>The past was close behind<br>He&#39;d seen a lot of women<br>But she never escaped his mind, and he just grew  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue  </p>
<p>She was workin’ in a topless place<br>And I stopped in for a beer<br>I just kept lookin’ at the side of her face<br>In the spotlight so clear  </p>
<p>And later on when the crowd thinned out  I was just about to do the same<br>She was standing there right beside my chair<br>Said, “Don’t tell me, let me guess your name?”  </p>
<p>I muttered somethin’ underneath my breath<br>She studied the lines on my face<br>I must admit I felt a little uneasy<br>When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue  </p>
<!-- She lit a burner on the stove  
And offered me a pipe  
“I thought you’d never say hello,” she said  
“You look like the silent type”  

Then she opened up a book of poems  
And handed it to me  
Written by an Italian poet  
From the thirteenth century  

And every one of them words rang true  
And glowed like burnin’ coal  
Pourin’ off of every page  
Like it was written in my soul from me to you   -->  
<!--   
Tangled up in blue   -->  

<p>I lived with them on Montague Street<br>In a basement down the stairs<br>There was music in the cafés at night<br>And revolution in the air  </p>
<p>Then he started into dealing with slaves<br>And something inside of him died<br>She had to sell everything she owned<br>And froze up inside  </p>
<p>And when it all came crashing down<br>I became withdrawn<br>The only thing I knew how to do<br>Was keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue  </p>
<p>So now I’m goin’ on back again<br>I got to get to them somehow<br>All the faces we used to know<br>They’re an illusion to me now  </p>
<p>Some are mathematicians<br>Some are truck drivers’ wives<br>Don’t know how it all got started<br>I don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives  </p>
<p>But me, I’m still on the road<br>Headin’ for another joint<br>We always did feel the same<br>We just saw it from a different point of view  </p>
<p>Tangled up in blue</p>

          <p>The video linked here, and the version of the lyrics, is not the album version.</p>
<p>Dylan notably played with the lyrics of this song, probably partially because he was unsatisfied with the direction and feel of where his art was going at the time; the performance from the Rolling Thunder Revue, linked here, is of particular interest.</p>
<p>He was playing with Emmy Lou Harris and Roger McGuinn on this tour; the name of the tour was an explicit reference to the Nixon-era carpetbombing of Laos; his performances of &#39;Hurricane&#39; on this tour were passionate, and simultaneously carried on his reputation of &quot;protest songs&quot;, despite that being clearly something he felt he was trying to get rid of.</p>
<p>Point being: this tour, in some ways, was maybe the last concerted effort to play Cosmic American Music, as such.</p>
