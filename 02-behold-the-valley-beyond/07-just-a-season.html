<p>Dares and dreams and silly schemes and fillies running freely<br>I was young and no song was sung that didn&#39;t sound appealing<br>I&#39;d have my fun with a shy girl and maybe hop a train<br>And I&#39;d look back at her standing in the rain  </p>
<p>Dirty hands and root beer stands and money like a river<br>Making deals to see how it feels to get more than you&#39;re giving<br>I&#39;d have my fun with a gamblin&#39; man and bluff him with my face<br>And it&#39;s drinks for everybody in the place  </p>

<p>Shouting crowds and mummer&#39;s shrouds and people going crazy<br>Always said what was in their heads it surely was amazing<br>I had my fun in the bull ring and never got a scar<br>It really wasn&#39;t hard to be a star  </p>
