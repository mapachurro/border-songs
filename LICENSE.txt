## 5. wat, speak plainly plz

The goal of this project is to add to the global Body of Literature. As such, it's embedded in context, and I endeavour to cite that in a way that is factual, helpful, clear, and in compliance with legal regulation.

If you are inspired or want to use the code, go ahead; if you are inspired by or want to use the translations, please do so in compliance with copyright rules, and let me know :heart:
