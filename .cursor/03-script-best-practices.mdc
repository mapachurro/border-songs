# Script best practices

## Overall guidelines
1. We prefer nodeJS-based scripts, in case we want to make them part of the package.
2. However, for tasks that require e.g. parsing JSON, we have found Python to be much more reliable and faster to a working solution.


## Best practices
When writing scripts, please follow these best practices:
1. We will always prefer scripts that, from the beginning, have 
- Graceful failure fallbacks (e.g. try/catch blocks) and corresponding error handling.
- Human-readable logging to the console. 
- If the output is large, suggest the option of saving it to a file.
