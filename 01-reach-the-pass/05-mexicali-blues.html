Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand<br>Watching flies and children on the street<br>And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile<br>There&#39;s a little boy that wants to shine my feet<br>And it&#39;s three days ride from Bakersfield<br>And I don&#39;t know why I came<br>I guess I came to keep from payin&#39; dues<br>So instead I&#39;ve got a bottle and a girl who&#39;s just fourteen<br>And a damned good case of the Mexicali blues  </p>
<p>Is there anything a man don&#39;t stand to lose<br>When the devil wants to take it all away<br>Cherish well your thoughts, keep a tight grip on your booze<br>&#39;Cause thinking and drinking are all I have today  </p>
<p>She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town<br>I didn&#39;t know her stage-line ran from hell<br>She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold<br>And all the french perfume you&#39;d care to smell<br>She took me up in to her room and whispered in my ear<br>Go on my friend, do anything you choose<br>Now I&#39;m payin&#39; for those happy hours I spent there in her arms<br>With a lifetime&#39;s worth of the Mexicali blues  </p>
<p>And then a man rode in to town, some thought he was the law<br>Billie Jean was waiting when he came<br>She told me he would take her if I didn&#39;t use my gun<br>And I&#39;d have no one but myself to blame<br>I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind<br>I guess that stranger hadn&#39;t heard the news<br>&#39;Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord he didn&#39;t even draw<br>And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali blues (note 1)  </p>
<p>Is there anything a man don&#39;t stand to lose<br>When he lets a woman hold him in her hands<br>You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark<br>Just riding and running across those desert sands  </p>
<p>(1) sometime in 1973 Bob Weir changed this line to &quot;Now I spend my lifetime running with the Mexicali blues&quot; - he sings the original line up to DP28 (Feb 73) but the new line on DP19 (Oct 73) and subsequently. Thanks to Neal Miskin for pointing this out to me.</p>
