Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There&#39;s a little boy that wants to shine my feet
And it&#39;s three days ride from Bakersfield
And I don&#39;t know why I came
I guess I came to keep from payin&#39; dues
So instead I&#39;ve got a bottle and a girl who&#39;s just fourteen
And a damned good case of the Mexicali blues</p>
<p>Is there anything a man don&#39;t stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away
Cherish well your thoughts, keep a tight grip on your booze
&#39;Cause thinking and drinking are all I have today</p>
<p>She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn&#39;t know her stage-line ran from hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
And all the french perfume you&#39;d care to smell
She took me up in to her room and whispered in my ear
Go on my friend, do anything you choose
Now I&#39;m payin&#39; for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime&#39;s worth of the Mexicali blues</p>
<p>And then a man rode in to town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her if I didn&#39;t use my gun
And I&#39;d have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn&#39;t heard the news
&#39;Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord he didn&#39;t even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali blues (note 1)</p>
<p>Is there anything a man don&#39;t stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands</p>
<p>(1) sometime in 1973 Bob Weir changed this line to &quot;Now I spend my lifetime running with the Mexicali blues&quot; - he sings the original line up to DP28 (Feb 73) but the new line on DP19 (Oct 73) and subsequently. Thanks to Neal Miskin for pointing this out to me.</p>
