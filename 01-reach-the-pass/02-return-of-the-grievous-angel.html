          <p>:<br>Won&#39;t you scratch my itch, sweet Annie Rich<br>And welcome me back to town?<br>Come out on your porch or I&#39;ll step into your parlor<br>And I&#39;ll tell you how it all went down<br><br />
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels<br>And a good saloon in every single town<br>Oh, and I remembered something you once told me<br>And I&#39;ll be damned if it did not come true<br><br />
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down<br>And they all lead me straight back home to you<br><br />
&#39;Cause I headed West to grow up with the country<br>Across those prairies with the waves of grain<br><br />
And I saw my devil<br>And I saw my deep blue sea<br>And I thought about a calico bonnet from<br>Cheyenne to Tennessee<br><br />
We flew straight across that river bridge<br>Last night, half past two<br>The switchman wave his lantern goodbye<br>And good day as we went rolling through<br><br />
Billboards and truckstops passed by the grievous angel<br>And now I know just what I have to do<br><br />
And the man on the radio won&#39;t leave me alone<br>He wants to take my money for something<br>That I&#39;ve never been shown<br><br />
And I saw my devil<br>And I saw my deep blue sea<br>And I thought about a calico bonnet from<br>Cheyenne to Tennessee<br><br />
The news I could bring, I met up with the king<br>On his head, an amphetamine crown<br>He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt<br>And lighted out for some desert town<br><br />
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels<br>And a good saloon in every single town<br>Oh, but I remembered something you once told me<br>And I&#39;ll be damned if it did not come true<br><br />
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down<br>And they all lead me straight back home to you<br>Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down<br>And they all lead me straight back home to you</p>
