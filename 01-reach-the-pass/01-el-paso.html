          <p>Out in the West Texas town of El Paso<br>I fell in love with a Mexican girl<br>Nighttime would find me in Rosa&#39;s cantina<br>Music would play and Felina would whirl  </p>
<p>Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina<br>Wicked and evil while casting a spell<br>My love was deep for this Mexican maiden<br>I was in love, but in vain I could tell  </p>
<p>One night, a wild young cowboy came in<br>Wild as the West Texas wind<br>Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing<br>With wicked Felina, the girl that I loved  </p>
<p>So in anger<br>I challenged his right for the love of this maiden<br>Down went his hand for the gun that he wore<br>My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat<br>The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor  </p>
<p>Just for a moment, I stood there in silence<br>Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done<br>Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there<br>I had but one chance and that was to run  </p>
<p>Out through the back door of Rosa&#39;s I ran<br>Out where the horses were tied<br>I caught a good one, it looked like it could run<br>Up on its back and away I did ride  </p>
<p>Just as fast as I<br>Could from the West Texas town of El Paso<br>Out to the badlands of New Mexico<br>Back in El Paso, my life would be worthless<br>Everything&#39;s gone in life, nothing is left<br>It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve seen the young maiden<br>My love is stronger than my fear of death<br>I saddled up and away I did go<br>Riding alone in the dark<br>Maybe tomorrow, a bullet may find me<br>Tonight nothing&#39;s worse than this pain in my heart<br>And at last here I am on the hill, overlooking El Paso<br>I can see Rosa&#39;s cantina below<br>My love is strong and it pushes me onward<br>Down off the hill to Felina I go<br>Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys<br>Off to my left ride a dozen or more<br>Shouting and shooting, I can&#39;t let them catch me<br>I have to make it to Rosa&#39;s back door<br>Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel<br>A deep burning pain in my side<br>Though I am trying to stay in the saddle<br>I&#39;m getting weary, unable to ride<br>But my love for Felina is strong and I rise where I&#39;ve fallen<br>Though I am weary, I can&#39;t stop to rest<br>I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle<br>I feel the bullet go deep in my chest<br>From out of nowhere Felina has found me<br>Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side<br>Cradled by two loving arms that I&#39;ll die for<br>One little kiss and Felina, goodbye</p>
