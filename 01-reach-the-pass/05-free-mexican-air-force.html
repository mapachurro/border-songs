          <p>In the Morenos Mountains campesinos are planting their fields<br>While the ghost of Zapata rides a horse that can still outrun the wheel<br>There, free in the sky high above, nearly clear out of sight<br>It&#39;s the Free Mexican Air Force flyin&#39; tonight  </p>
<p>In the City of Angels, a cowboy is cooling his heels<br>Remembering that God gave us herbs and the fruits of the fields<br>But a criminal law that makes outlaws of those seeking light<br>Made the Free Mexican Air Force -- Mescalito riding his white horse --<br>Yeah, the Free Mexican Air Force is flyin&#39; tonight!<br>Flying so high - yi - hiyeeeee! ...  </p>
<p>How strange that an innocent herb causes money to burn<br>They&#39;ll jail you or kill you for making those rich fat cats squirm<br>They&#39;re the fools who make rules with no difference between wrong or right<br>That&#39;s why the Free Mexican Air Force is flyin&#39; tonight  </p>
<p>Uncle Sam in his misery put a nix on the fields of Guerrero<br>Sayin&#39;, &quot;Shoot down all gringos and wetbacks who dare wear sombreros!&quot;<br>Either run for your life, surrender, or stand up and fight --<br>Or join the Free Mexican Air Force -- Mescalito riding his white horse --<br>Yeah, the Free Mexican Air Force is flying tonight!<br>Flying so high - yi - hiyeeeee! ...  </p>
<p>(instrumental bridge)  </p>
<p>It is not marijuana destroying the minds of the young<br>But confusion continued for power and greed in all forms<br>Well, the borders of evil will fall to the smugglers of light!<br>We&#39;re the Free Mexican Air Force and we&#39;re flyin&#39; tonight!  </p>
<p>In San Antonio, they tell me that power and money are one<br>They can buy us or sell you to keep you afraid, on the run<br>But no one can stop us! My vision is clearly in sight!<br>And the Free Mexican Air Force -- Mescalito riding his white horse --<br>Yeah, the Free Mexican Air Force is flyin&#39; tonight!<br>Flying so high - yi - hiyeeeee! ...  </p>
<p>Some were smoking colitas while other were loading their guns<br>Blowing smoke from their six-shooters, spinning their barrels for fun<br>Contrabandistas, banditos alike --<br>We&#39;re the Free Mexican Air Force and we&#39;re flyin&#39; tonight!  </p>
<p>High in the hills we are harvesting sweet sensimillia<br>Yeah, the law wants it all &#39;cause they know that the wild weed can free ya<br>And freedom for us is a prison for the rulers of might!<br>That&#39;s why the Free Mexican Air Force -- Mescalito riding his white horse --<br>Yeah, the Free Texican Air Force is flyin&#39; tonight!<br>Flyin&#39; so high- yi- yee...<br>Flyin&#39; tonight!</p>
