<p>Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand<br>Watchin&#39; flies and children on the street<br>And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile<br>There&#39;s a little boy who wants to shine my feet  </p>
<p>And it&#39;s three days ride from Bakersfield and I don&#39;t know why I came<br>I guess I came to keep from payin&#39; dues<br>So instead I&#39;ve got a bottle and a girl who&#39;s just fourteen<br>And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues Yeh  </p>
<p>Is there anything a man don&#39;t stand to lose<br>When the devil wants to take it all away?<br>Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze<br>&#39;Cause thinkin&#39; and drinkin&#39; are all I have today  </p>
<p>She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town<br>I didn&#39;t know a stage line ran from hell<br>She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold<br>All the french perfume you&#39;d care to smell  </p>
<p>She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear<br>Go on, my friend, do anything you choose<br>Now I&#39;m payin&#39; for those happy hours I spent there in her arms<br>With a lifetime&#39;s worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeh  </p>
<p>Is there anything a man don&#39;t stand to lose<br>When the devil wants to take it all away?<br>Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze<br>&#39;Cause thinkin&#39; and drinkin&#39; are all I have today  </p>
<p>And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law<br>Billy Jean was waitin&#39; when he came<br>She told me he would take her, if I didn&#39;t use my gun<br>I&#39;d have no one but myself to blame  </p>
<p>I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind<br>I guess that stranger hadn&#39;t heard the news<br>&#39;Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn&#39;t even draw<br>And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues, yeh  </p>
<p>Is there anything a man don&#39;t stand to lose<br>When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?<br>He just might find himself out there on horseback in the dark<br>Just ridin&#39; and runnin&#39; across those desert sands</p>
