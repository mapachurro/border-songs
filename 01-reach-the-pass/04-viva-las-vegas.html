<p>Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watchin&#39; flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There&#39;s a little boy who wants to shine my feet</p>
<p>And it&#39;s three days ride from Bakersfield and I don&#39;t know why I came
I guess I came to keep from payin&#39; dues
So instead I&#39;ve got a bottle and a girl who&#39;s just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues Yeh</p>
<p>Is there anything a man don&#39;t stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
&#39;Cause thinkin&#39; and drinkin&#39; are all I have today</p>
<p>She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn&#39;t know a stage line ran from hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the french perfume you&#39;d care to smell</p>
<p>She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
Go on, my friend, do anything you choose
Now I&#39;m payin&#39; for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime&#39;s worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeh</p>
<p>Is there anything a man don&#39;t stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
&#39;Cause thinkin&#39; and drinkin&#39; are all I have today</p>
<p>And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billy Jean was waitin&#39; when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn&#39;t use my gun
I&#39;d have no one but myself to blame</p>
<p>I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn&#39;t heard the news
&#39;Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn&#39;t even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues, yeh</p>
<p>Is there anything a man don&#39;t stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
He just might find himself out there on horseback in the dark
Just ridin&#39; and runnin&#39; across those desert sands</p>
