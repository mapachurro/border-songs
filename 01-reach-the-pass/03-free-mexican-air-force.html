<p>In the Morenos Mountains campesinos are planting their fields
While the ghost of Zapata rides a horse that can still outrun the wheel
There, free in the sky high above, nearly clear out of sight
It&#39;s the Free Mexican Air Force flyin&#39; tonight</p>
<p>In the City of Angels, a cowboy is cooling his heels
Remembering that God gave us herbs and the fruits of the fields
But a criminal law that makes outlaws of those seeking light
Made the Free Mexican Air Force -- Mescalito riding his white horse --
Yeah, the Free Mexican Air Force is flyin&#39; tonight!
Flying so high - yi - hiyeeeee! ...</p>
<p>How strange that an innocent herb causes money to burn
They&#39;ll jail you or kill you for making those rich fat cats squirm
They&#39;re the fools who make rules with no difference between wrong or right
That&#39;s why the Free Mexican Air Force is flyin&#39; tonight</p>
<p>Uncle Sam in his misery put a nix on the fields of Guerrero
Sayin&#39;, &quot;Shoot down all gringos and wetbacks who dare wear sombreros!&quot;
Either run for your life, surrender, or stand up and fight --
Or join the Free Mexican Air Force -- Mescalito riding his white horse --
Yeah, the Free Mexican Air Force is flying tonight!
Flying so high - yi - hiyeeeee! ...</p>
<p>(instrumental bridge)</p>
<p>It is not marijuana destroying the minds of the young
But confusion continued for power and greed in all forms
Well, the borders of evil will fall to the smugglers of light!
We&#39;re the Free Mexican Air Force and we&#39;re flyin&#39; tonight!</p>
<p>In San Antonio, they tell me that power and money are one
They can buy us or sell you to keep you afraid, on the run
But no one can stop us! My vision is clearly in sight!
And the Free Mexican Air Force -- Mescalito riding his white horse --
Yeah, the Free Mexican Air Force is flyin&#39; tonight!
Flying so high - yi - hiyeeeee! ...</p>
<p>Some were smoking colitas while other were loading their guns
Blowing smoke from their six-shooters, spinning their barrels for fun
Contrabandistas, banditos alike --
We&#39;re the Free Mexican Air Force and we&#39;re flyin&#39; tonight!</p>
<p>High in the hills we are harvesting sweet sensimillia
Yeah, the law wants it all &#39;cause they know that the wild weed can free ya
And freedom for us is a prison for the rulers of might!
That&#39;s why the Free Mexican Air Force -- Mescalito riding his white horse --
Yeah, the Free Texican Air Force is flyin&#39; tonight!
Flyin&#39; so high- yi- yee...
Flyin&#39; tonight!</p>
