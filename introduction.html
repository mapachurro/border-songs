        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If any of the verses from Edward FitzGerald&#39;s 1859 translation, &quot;The Rub√°iy√°t of Omar Khayyam&quot;, sound familiar to you, they&#39;re probably these: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With me along the strip of Herbage strown<br>That just divides the desert from the sown,<br>Where name of Slave and Sultan is forgot--<br>And Peace to Mahmud on his golden Throne!  </p>
<p>A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,<br>A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread--and Thou<br>Beside me singing in the Wilderness--<br>Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In several important ways, the topic of the book you&#39;re looking at is all right there. This book is about <code>the strip of herbage strown /</code> <em>(sown?)</em> <code>That just divides the desert from the sown</code> <em>(town)</em>?</p>
<p>This book is about <strong>bord</strong>ers, and <strong>lim</strong>its, and the tension and space between them, and across them.</p>
<hr>
<p>Borders show up in lots of places. The word, on a long enough timeline, might be as old as Proto-Indo-European, although it&#39;s stil unclear. There was an old word that sounded like this, and it referred to &quot;cutting&quot;. From there, it came to refer to a &#39;board&#39;, as in, a cut piece of wood, and from there, the &quot;side&quot;, or &quot;edge&quot; of a boat, and then <em>maybe</em>, from there, the colorful edge around a shield, and from there, the decorated edge of a garment, and from there... You get the picture.</p>
<p>A strip of herbage between the desert and the sown; between what&#39;s been cultivated, civilized, and that which is wild.</p>
<hr>
<p>And there are limits to everything, perhaps even the explanatory power of these metaphors and explanations. But where do we place the limit?</p>
<p>The limit was, as far back as we can recall, the <code>limen</code> in Latin-speaking households: the threshold, the doorway between the domestic <em>(domus)</em> and the savage <em>(silva)</em>. From there, it became a boundary or limit between fields; the hedgerows of FitzGerald&#39;s Britain come easily to mind, strips of herbage between the sown.</p>
<hr>
<p>This book, then, is about songs of the border, or liminal songs, if you like.</p>
