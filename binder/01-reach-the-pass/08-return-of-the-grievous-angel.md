Won't you scratch my itch, sweet Annie Rich  
And welcome me back to town?  
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlor  
And I'll tell you how it all went down  
<br />  
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels  
And a good saloon in every single town  
Oh, and I remembered something you once told me  
And I'll be damned if it did not come true  
<br />  
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down  
And they all lead me straight back home to you  
<br />  
'Cause I headed West to grow up with the country  
Across those prairies with the waves of grain  
<br />  
And I saw my devil  
And I saw my deep blue sea  
And I thought about a calico bonnet from  
Cheyenne to Tennessee  
<br />  
We flew straight across that river bridge  
Last night, half past two  
The switchman wave his lantern goodbye  
And good day as we went rolling through  
<br />  
Billboards and truckstops passed by the grievous angel  
And now I know just what I have to do  
<br />  
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone  
He wants to take my money for something  
That I've never been shown  
<br />  
And I saw my devil  
And I saw my deep blue sea  
And I thought about a calico bonnet from  
Cheyenne to Tennessee  
<br />  
The news I could bring, I met up with the king  
On his head, an amphetamine crown  
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt  
And lighted out for some desert town  
<br />  
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels  
And a good saloon in every single town  
Oh, but I remembered something you once told me  
And I'll be damned if it did not come true  
<br />  
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down  
And they all lead me straight back home to you  
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down  
And they all lead me straight back home to you
