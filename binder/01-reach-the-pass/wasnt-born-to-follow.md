## Carole King:
No, I'd rather go and journey
Where the diamond crescents flowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
<br />
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
That break the light up into colours
That no one know the names of
<br />
And when it's time I'll go and wait
Beside the legendary fountain
'Til I see her form reflected
In its clear and jewelled waters
<br />
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another
<br />
And I'll stay awhile and wonder
At the mist that they've created
And lose myself within it
Cleanse my mind and body
<br />
And I know at that moment
As I stand in that cathedral
I will want to dive
Beneath the white cascading water
<br />
She may beg and she may plead
And she may argue with her logic
Mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value
<br />
Though I doubt that she will ever
Come to understand my meaning
In the end she'll surely know
I was not born to follow

## Roger McGuinn:

Where the diamond crescent's glowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
And break the light in colors

And when it's time I'll go and lay
Beside the legendary fountain
'Till I see her form reflected
In its clear and jewelled waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another
I will want to dive beneath the white cascading waters
She may beg, she may plead, she may argue with her logic
And mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value in the end she will surely know
