# Title: Wasn't born to follow

# Source
No I'd rather go and journey
Where the diamond crescent's glowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
<br />
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
And break the light in colors
That no one know the names of
<br />
And when it's time I'll go and wait 
Beside the legendary fountain
'Till I see your (her) form reflected
In its clear and jewelled waters
<br />
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another
<br />
**(And I'll stay awhile and wonder
At the mist that they've created
And lose myself within it
Cleanse my mind and body)**
<br />
**(And I know at that moment
As I stand in that cathedral)**
I will want to dive beneath 
the white cascading waters
<br />
She may beg, she may plead, 
She may argue with her logic
And mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value 
<br />
**(Though I doubt that she will ever
Come to understand my meaning)**
In the end she will (she'll) surely know
I wasn't (was not) born to follow**

# Target
Mas me vale andar errante
Donde arde el diamante menguante
Correr lo largo de la valle
Ante la montaña sagrada
<br />
Y vagar por aquel bosque
Donde cosechan los arboles hojas de prismas
Y le rompen la luz en colores
Cuyos nombres se desconocen
<br />
Y cuando llegue la hora ire a esperar
Al lado de la fuente de la leyenda
Hasta ver tu figura reflejada
Entre sus aguas nítidas enjoyadas
<br />
Y si tu ya ves que me preparé
Que me lleves al abismo
Adonde los corriente de nuestra vista
Se entremezclen y se unan
<br />
Y me quedaré otro rato ponderando
Sobre la neblina que hayan creado
Y me perderé entre ella
Limpiarme mente y cuerpo
<br />
Y yo sé en aquel momento
Al pararme en aquel catedral
Voy a querer sumergirme bajo
las blancas aguas en cascada
<br />
Que ella me ruega, que me suplique,
que me lo discuta con su lógica
Y mencionar todas aquellas cosas que perderé
Que realmente carecen de valor
<br />
Aunque dude que ella nunca 
llegase a entender lo que me significa
Al final, seguramente ella sabrá
No nací yo para andar detrás

# Commentary

>
> The difference between Goffin-King and McGuinn here is between `her` and `your` form
> This small change opens up the story. This is not necessarily a love song or a traditional 'romance' in the medieval sense. 
> This may be a love triangle situation. Or a conversation with something that is not human. This may be a conversation with a higher power, a god, Nature, or even some part of yourself you're looking for. Given that, at the time, McGuinn was trying to write the soundtrack for Easy Rider -- They went looking for America, and couldn't find it anywhere -- the implication that he is, in fact, Buscando America is a tantalizing one.

# Notes

Apparently, Goffin and King wrote this, and gave the rights to it to the Byrds' manager before they ever recorded it, so McGuinn's version was the first to be recorded. King's version wasn't recorded and or released until 1980.

This provides for very interesting questions about canonicity. The subtle differences between the Goffin-King and McGuinn versions have a lot to play with, as well. It's not that Goffin-King consistently used more formal language as compared to McGuinn, although arguably it is more 'standard English', whereas McGuinn is clearly trying to inflect the song with the emergent flavor of Western-Cosmic American Music that, at the time, they were beginning to give shape to.

## Carole King:
No, I'd rather go and journey
Where the diamond crescents flowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
<br />
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
That break the light up into colours
That no one know the names of
<br />
And when it's time I'll go and wait
Beside the legendary fountain
'Til I see her form reflected
In its clear and jewelled waters
<br />
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another
<br />
And I'll stay awhile and wonder
At the mist that they've created
And lose myself within it
Cleanse my mind and body
<br />
And I know at that moment
As I stand in that cathedral
I will want to dive
Beneath the white cascading water
<br />
She may beg and she may plead
And she may argue with her logic
Mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value
<br />
Though I doubt that she will ever
Come to understand my meaning
In the end she'll surely know
I was not born to follow

## Roger McGuinn:

## mapachurro's attempt at reconciliation
No I'd rather go and journey
Where the diamond crescent's glowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
<br />
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
And break the light in colors
That no one know the names of
<br />
And when it's time I'll go and lay
Beside the legendary fountain
'Till I see her form reflected
In its clear and jewelled waters
<br />
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another
