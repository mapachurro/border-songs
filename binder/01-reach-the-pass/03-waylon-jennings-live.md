Drunk at the Meskwaki casino  
Right where God intended me to be  
Looking up at the one man in this room  
Who's handled more cocaine then me  

Think back on the good times just an hour or so ago  
Before I got myself this drunk  
When the valet parked my rented Mitsubishi  
With a beat up old brown suitcase in the trunk  

Full of firearms and flash drives  
Full of passports  
And international money orders  
For just in case I make it cross the border  

Get a postcard from the gift shop  
Let my family know I'm doing fine  
Looking up at a map up on the ceiling  
To find the place where we all meet up further on down the line  

Head back to my table  
Get another scotch and soda for the road  
The band on stage is really working off a head of steam  
Close my eyes and lean my head back, dream a little dream  

Full of firearms and flash drives  
Full of passports  
And international money orders  
For just in case I make it cross the border
