# Title: Mexicali Blues

Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand  
Watching flies and children on the street  
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile  
There's a little boy that wants to shine my feet  
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield  
And I don't know why I came  
I guess I came to keep from payin' dues  
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen  
And a damned good case of the Mexicali blues  

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose  
When the devil wants to take it all away  
Cherish well your thoughts, keep a tight grip on your booze  
'Cause thinking and drinking are all I have today  

She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town  
I didn't know her stage-line ran from hell  
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold  
And all the french perfume you'd care to smell  
She took me up in to her room and whispered in my ear  
Go on my friend, do anything you choose  
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms  
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali blues  

And then a man rode in to town, some thought he was the law  
Billie Jean was waiting when he came  
She told me he would take her if I didn't use my gun  
And I'd have no one but myself to blame  
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind  
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news  
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord he didn't even draw  
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali blues (note 1)  

Is there anything a man don't stand to lose  
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands  
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark  
Just riding and running across those desert sands  

(1) sometime in 1973 Bob Weir changed this line to "Now I spend my lifetime running with the Mexicali blues" - he sings the original line up to DP28 (Feb 73) but the new line on DP19 (Oct 73) and subsequently. Thanks to Neal Miskin for pointing this out to me.
