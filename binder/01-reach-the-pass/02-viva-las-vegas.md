Bright Light City gonna set my soul  
It's gonna set my soul on fire  
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn  
So, get those stakes up high  

There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there  
They're all waiting, they'll never make air  
And I'm just a devil with a lung to spare  

So, viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  

How I wish that there were more  
Than the twenty-four hours in the day  
Even if I ran out of speed, boy  
I wouldn't sleep a minute of the way  

Oh, there's blackjack, poker, and the roulette wheel  
I'll poach your money lost on every deal  
All you need is sonar and nerves of steel  
You might also like  

So, viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  

Viva Las Vegas where the neon signs flash your name  
The one-arm bandits cash in, all soap's down the drain  
Viva Las Vegas  
Turning day into nighttime, turning night into daytime  
If you see it once, you'll never be the same again  
 
Gotta keep on runnin', gonna have me some money  
If it costs me my very last dime  
If I wind up broke then I'll always remember that  
I had a swingin' time  
 
Oh, I'm gonna give it everything I've got  
Lady Luck's with me, the dice stay hot  
Got coke up my nose to dry away the snot  

So, viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  
Viva Las Vegas  
Viva, viva Las Vegas
