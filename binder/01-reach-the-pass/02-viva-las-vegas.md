[Verse 1]
Bright Light City gonna set my soul
It's gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So, get those stakes up high

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
They're all waiting, they'll never make air
And I'm just a devil with a lung to spare

[Chorus]
So, viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas

[Verse 2]
How I wish that there were more
Than the twenty-four hours in the day
Even if I ran out of speed, boy
I wouldn't sleep a minute of the way

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's blackjack, poker, and the roulette wheel
I'll poach your money lost on every deal
All you need is sonar and nerves of steel
You might also like
[Chorus]
So, viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas

[Bridge]
Viva Las Vegas where the neon signs flash your name
The one-arm bandits cash in, all soap's down the drain
Viva Las Vegas
Turning day into nighttime, turning night into daytime
If you see it once, you'll never be the same again

[Verse 3]
Gotta keep on runnin', gonna have me some money
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke then I'll always remember that
I had a swingin' time

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady Luck's with me, the dice stay hot
Got coke up my nose to dry away the snot

[Chorus]
So, viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva, viva Las Vegas
