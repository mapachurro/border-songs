## Introduction

Welcome to Side 1 of this four-sided, annotated-play collection of tracks.

Como bien se tratan de pistas, en eso seguiremos: seguir las pistas, y el camino que nos enseñan.

We come to ourselves, not in a snowy wood, but perhaps on the edge of the wood; the trees have been thinning out and changing for some time now, and here they give way to grasslands, stretching off to an interminable horizon. What lies further afield?

There is an idea that is so deeply embedded in the idea and the experience of the Americas, plural, that it can be difficult to put your finger on it. It's under the surface, always, and on the surface, in the cheerful disposition that North Americans are often stereotyped with.

In short: it's the idea that somewhere out there, más allá que el horizonte, once we come down from the mountain, we can be more; we can make of the land, of our time, and of ourselves, what we wish.

Tracing this path back to its source would be a fool's errand, a wild goose chase greater than the professional careers of multiple academicians. This track in the wilderness has no single starting point, only increasing innumerable upstream tributaries. 

So let's establish that, for now, we have come to ourselves on some point of this westbound path, and this is the map that we have been given to follow.

It's an error to think of poetry as something relegated to the domain of a canon, of strict rules of rhyme and verse. It might help to think beyond those walls, and think not of poetry, but of *poetics*.

And poetics doesn't belong to the academy, or to the canon, or to some imagined Western phallogocentric iron-bound casket of Art and Knowledge. Poetics is, are, explicitly unbound. Poetics is something that you discover at the woody substance at the heart of language; at the fuzzy edges of grammar where language is constantly reinventing itself; in dance and voluptuousness, in the branch clusters of the tumbleweed and the clusters of its leaves; in colorless green ideas sleeping furiously: in the impossible and deeply necessary aporia of translating. Translating oneself to the other, translating ideas to words, translating from one language to another.

It is the intention of poetics to push expression to its limit, push language past its limits, to try and capture something that resists.

**It is in the poetics of the border that we paradoxically find its most clear expression. At the limits of expression, we find the expression of the limit.**

---

But poetics do not exist in a vacuum. They do not come from nowhere, and they build upon each other, call out to each other, forward, backwards, and across. In the Americas, poetic traditions weave in and out of being "just a song", to being part of our psyche, to being an expression of identity, to summing up an entire epoch of history; "Just a Season".

So we will start our journey in the Desert Spring. It is the 1960s in the United States, and angelheaded hipsters are burning for an ancient heavenly connection to a starry dynamo, through the gears of the machine that they threw their bodies upon to make it stop.

When you go searching for the ancient heavenly connection to a starry dynamo, where do you go? You go to the wilderness. You seek your roots, your water; you go out into the desert, with a billion stars all around: with nothing left to lose, and everything to gain.
