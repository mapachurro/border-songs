## Introduction

Welcome to Side 1 of this four-sided, annotated-play collection of tracks.

Como bien se tratan de pistas, en eso seguiremos: seguir las pistas, y el camino que nos enseñan.

We come to ourselves, not in a snowy wood, but perhaps on the edge of the wood; the trees have been thinning out and changing for some time now, and here they give way to grasslands, stretching off to an interminable horizon. What lies further afield?

There is an idea that is so deeply embedded in the idea and the experience of the Americas, plural, that it can be difficult to put your finger on it. It's under the surface, always, and on the surface, in the cheerful disposition that North Americans are often stereotyped with.

In short: it's the idea that somewhere out there, más allá que el horizonte, once we come down from the mountain, we can be more; we can make of the land, of our time, and of ourselves, what we wish.

Tracing this path back to its source would be a fool's errand, a wild goose chase greater than the professional careers of multiple academicians. This track in the wilderness has no single starting point, only increasing innumerable upstream tributaries. 

So let's establish that, for now, we have come to ourselves on some point of this westbound path, and this is the map that we have been given to follow.
