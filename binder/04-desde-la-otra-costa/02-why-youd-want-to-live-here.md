I'm in Los Angeles today  
It smells like an airport runway  
Jet fuel stenches in the cabin  
And lights flickering at random  
I'm in Los Angeles today  
Garbage cans comprise the medians  
Of freeways always creeping  
Even when the population's sleeping  
And I can't see why you'd want to live here  
I'm in Los Angeles today  
Asked a gas station employee  
If he ever had trouble breathing  
And he said, "It varies from season to season, kid"  
It's where our best are on display  
Motion picture actors' houses maps  
Are never ever current  
So save your film and 15 dollars  
And I can't see why you'd want to live here  
Billboards reach past the tallest buildings  
"We are not perfect, but we sure try"  
As UV rays degradate our youth with time  
The vessel keeps pumping us through this entropic place  
In the belly of the beast that is California  
I drank from a faucet, and I kept my receipt  
For when they weigh me on my way out here, nothing is free  
But the Greyhounds keep coming  
Dumping locusts into the streets  
'Til the gutters overflow and Los Angeles thinks  
"I might explode someday soon"  
It's a lovely summer's day  
I can almost see a skyline through  
A thickening shroud of egos  
Is this the city of angels or demons?  
And here the names are what remain  
Stars encapsulate the golden lame  
And they need constant cleaning  
For when the tourists begin salivating  
And I can't see why you'd want to live here  
Billboards reach past the tallest buildings  
You can't swim in a town this shallow  
As you will most assuredly drown tomorrow
