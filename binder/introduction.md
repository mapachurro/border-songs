## Introduction

If any of the verses from Edward FitzGerald's 1859 translation, "The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyam", sound familiar to you, they're probably these: 

>
> With me along the strip of Herbage strown
> That just divides the desert from the sown,
> Where name of Slave and Sultan is forgot--
> And Peace to Mahmud on his golden Throne!
> 
> A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,
> A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread--and Thou
> Beside me singing in the Wilderness--
> Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow
> 

In several important ways, the topic of the book you're looking at is all right there. This book is about `the strip of herbage strown /` *(sown?)* `That just divides the desert from the sown` *(town)*?

This book is about **bord**ers, and **lim**its, and the tension and space between them, and across them.

Borders show up in lots of places. The word, on a long enough timeline, might be as old as Proto-Indo-European, although it's stil unclear. There was an old word that sounded like this, and it referred to "cutting". From there, it came to refer to a 'board', as in, a cut piece of wood, and from there, the "side", or "edge" of a boat, and then *maybe*, from there, the colorful edge around a shield, and from there, the decorated edge of a garment, and from there... You get the picture.

A strip of herbage between the desert and the sown; between what's been cultivated, civilized, and that which is wild.

And there are limits to everything, perhaps even the explanatory power of these metaphors and explanations. But where do we place the limit?

The limit was, as far back as we can recall, the `limen` in Latin-speaking households: the threshold, the doorway between the domestic *(domus)* and the savage *(silva)*. From there, it became a boundary or limit between fields; the hedgerows of FitzGerald's Britain come easily to mind, strips of herbage between the sown.

This book, then, is about songs of the border, or liminal songs, if you like.
