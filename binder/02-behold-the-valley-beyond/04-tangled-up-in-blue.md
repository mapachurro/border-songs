Early one mornin’ the sun was shinin’  
She was lyin’ in bed  
Wond’rin’ if she’d changed at all  
If her hair was still red  

Her folks they said our lives together  
Sure was gonna be rough  
They never did like Mama’s homemade dress  
Papa’s bankbook wasn’t big enough  

He was standin’ on the side of the road  
Rain fallin’ on his shoes  
Heading out for the East Coast  
Lord knows he'd paid some dues gettin’ through  

Tangled up in blue  

She was married when they first met  
Soon to be divorced  
He helped her out of a jam, I guess  
But he used a little too much force  

And they drove that car as far as they could  
Abandoned it out West  
Splitting up on a dark sad night  
Both agreeing it was best  

She turned around to look at him  
As he was walkin’ away  
Saying over her shoulder  
“We’ll meet again someday on the avenue”  

Tangled up in blue  

He had a job in Santa Fe  
Working in an old hotel  
But he never did like it all that much  
And one day it just went to hell  

So he drifted down to New Orleans  
Lucky not to be destroyed  
Where he got him a job on a fishin’ boat  
Docked outside Delacroix  

But all the while he was alone  
The past was close behind  
He'd seen a lot of women  
But she never escaped his mind, and he just grew  

Tangled up in blue  

She was workin’ in a topless place  
And I stopped in for a beer  
I just kept lookin’ at the side of her face  
In the spotlight so clear  

And later on when the crowd thinned out  I was just about to do the same  
She was standing there right beside my chair  
Said, “Don’t tell me, let me guess your name?”  

I muttered somethin’ underneath my breath  
She studied the lines on my face  
I must admit I felt a little uneasy  
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe  

Tangled up in blue  

<!-- She lit a burner on the stove  
And offered me a pipe  
“I thought you’d never say hello,” she said  
“You look like the silent type”  

Then she opened up a book of poems  
And handed it to me  
Written by an Italian poet  
From the thirteenth century  

And every one of them words rang true  
And glowed like burnin’ coal  
Pourin’ off of every page  
Like it was written in my soul from me to you   -->
<!-- 
Tangled up in blue   -->

I lived with them on Montague Street  
In a basement down the stairs  
There was music in the cafés at night  
And revolution in the air  

Then he started into dealing with slaves  
And something inside of him died  
She had to sell everything she owned  
And froze up inside  

And when it all came crashing down  
I became withdrawn  
The only thing I knew how to do  
Was keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew  

Tangled up in blue  

So now I’m goin’ on back again  
I got to get to them somehow  
All the faces we used to know  
They’re an illusion to me now  

Some are mathematicians  
Some are truck drivers’ wives  
Don’t know how it all got started  
I don’t know what they’re doin’ with their lives  

But me, I’m still on the road  
Headin’ for another joint  
We always did feel the same  
We just saw it from a different point of view  

Tangled up in blue

# Notes:  

The video linked here, and the version of the lyrics, is not the album version.

Dylan notably played with the lyrics of this song, probably partially because he was unsatisfied with the direction and feel of where his art was going at the time; the performance from the Rolling Thunder Revue, linked here, is of particular interest.

He was playing with Emmy Lou Harris and Roger McGuinn on this tour; the name of the tour was an explicit reference to the Nixon-era carpetbombing of Laos; his performances of 'Hurricane' on this tour were passionate, and simultaneously carried on his reputation of "protest songs", despite that being clearly something he felt he was trying to get rid of.

Point being: this tour, in some ways, was maybe the last concerted effort to play Cosmic American Music, as such.
