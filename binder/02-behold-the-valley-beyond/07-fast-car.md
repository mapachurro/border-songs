You got a fast car  
I want a ticket to anywhere  
Maybe we can make a deal  
Maybe together we can get somewhere  
Any place is better  
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose  
Maybe we'll make something  
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove  
You got a fast car  
I got a plan to get us out of here  
I been working at the convenience store  
Managed to save just a little bit of money  
Won't have to drive too far  
Just 'cross the border and into the city  
You and I can both get jobs  
And finally see what it means to be living  
See, my old man's got a problem  
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is  
He say his body's too old for working  
His body's too young to look like his  
My mama went off and left him  
She wanted more from life than he could give  
I said somebody's got to take care of him  
So I quit school and that's what I did  
You got a fast car  
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?  
We gotta make a decision  
Leave tonight or live and die this way  
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged  
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  
You got a fast car  
We go cruising to entertain ourselves  
You still ain't got a job  
And I work in the market as a checkout girl  
I know things will get better  
You'll find work and I'll get promoted  
And we'll move out of the shelter  
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs  
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged  
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  
You got a fast car  
I got a job that pays all our bills  
You stay out drinking late at the bar  
See more of your friends than you do your kids  
I'd always hoped for better  
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it  
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere  
So take your fast car and keep on driving  
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car  
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk  
City lights lay out before us  
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder  
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged  
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone  
You got a fast car  
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?  
You gotta make a decision  
Leave tonight or live and die this way

# Notes
- translation
- analysis
- the fact that Combs didn't change the gender
- the border issue
- the change of the last chorus: 'you' is elided / dropped 
- is the subject implicit? I don't think it is; I think he explicitly states subject in earlier instances of the key phrase
