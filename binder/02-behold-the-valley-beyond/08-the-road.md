# Title: The Road

# Authority: 

# Source:
I can still remember  
Every song you played  
Long ago when we were younger  
And we rocked the night away  

How could I see a future then  
Where you would not grow old  
With such a fire in our belly  
Such a hunger in our souls  

I guess I probably loved you  
When those words rolled off your tongue  
Seemed that we were traveling  
Under some old lucky sun  

I know I couldn't save you  
And no one was to blame  
But the road we shared together once  
Will never be the same  

Hey, gone a long way  
Won't be coming 'round again  
Hey, with a song I pray  
And on wings of a song I'll fly away  

I wandered in the wilderness  
For a while, I was so lost  
To everything there is a season  
And every blessing has its cost  

So I took what you left me  
Put it to some use  
When looking for an answer  
With those three chords and the truth  

I come down from the mountain  
I come walking in your shoes  
I was taken for a gambler  
When I had no more to lose  

For you put me on that pathway  
How could I refuse  
And I've spend my whole life out here  
Working on the blues  

Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  

So I've carried on  
You can't be haunted by the past  
People come, people go  
And nothing ever lasts  

But I still think about you  
Wonder where you are  
Can you see me from some place  
Up there among the stars?  

But down here under heaven  
There never was a chart  
To guide our way across  
This crooked highway of the heart  

And if it's only all about  
The journey in the end  
On that road I'm glad  
I came to know you, my old friend  

Hey, gone a long way  
Won't be coming 'round again  
Hey, with a song I pray  
And on wings of a song I'll fly away  

I'll fly away  
I'll fly away  
I'll fly away  
Oh, oh  

# Target:  

Todavía recuerdo  
Cada canción que tú tocaste  
Hace tanto, de jóvenes  
Cuando pasabamos las noches de rockea  

Cómo iba a imaginarme un futuro pues  
En el que tú no envejeces  
Con el fuego que cargamos dentro  
Tanta hambre en nuestros almas  

Será que te amaba  
Con que te salían aquellas palabras  
Será que viajábamos   
Con un sol que suerte brillaba  

Yo sé que no te podía salvar  
Y no tuvo nadie la culpa  
Pero el camino que una vez compartíamos  
Jamás volverá a ser igual  

Ay, mucho he recorrido  
No volverá a pasar de nuevo  
Ay, en canto oraré   
Y con alas de canto, de aqui vuelo  

Iba vagando por el monte  
Por un tiempo, iba tan perdida  
Todo tiene su tiempo  
Y toda bendición te cobrará  

Así que me llevé lo que me dejaste  
Y lo puse a trabajar  
Fui a buscar un significado  
Con esas tres cuerdas y la verdad  

Me bajo de la montaña  
Bajo caminando en tus zapatos  
Me creían jugar al azar  
Que no me quedó mas que perder  

Pues en aquel camino me pusiste  
¿Cómo te lo iba a negar?  
Y me he pasado la vida entera aqui afuera  
Trabajando en los blues  

Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  

Así que he seguido adelante  
No vale que el pasado siempre te persiga (!!!)  
Personas llegan, y se van  
Y nada nunca durará  

Pero sigo pensando en tí  
Me pregunto dónde andarás  
¿Me podrás ver desde algún lugar  
más alla entre las estrellas?  

Pero acá debajo del cielo  
Nunca ha habido una carta  
Que nos guiara el camino  
En esta carretera chueca del corazón  

Y si todo esto se trata solamente  
Del viaje, al final  
En aquel camino me alegro  
Que te haya conocido, mi viejo amigo  

Ay, mucho he recorrido  
No vuelvo a pasar de nuevo  
Ay, en canto oraré   
Y con alas de canto, de aqui vuelo  

De aqui vuelo  
De aqui vuelo  
De aqui vuelo  

# Commentary:  

# Notes:  

This piece is heavily intertextual in several dimensions.

Emmylou's relationship to Gram took on a legendary dimension over the decades, inclduing that bizarre piece of work by First Aid Kit. This song was ranked by Rolling Stone as one of the greatest country songs of all time. Emmylou covered a number of Gram's pieces on albums, mainly in the seventies, as well as covers by a lot of other artists. In fact, some of her albums include almost no original songwriting.

So the predecessor to this song, "Boulder to Birmingham", was never just another Emmylou track. On the album on which it was released, it stands out, in a class of its own. And it's notable, as a piece of her own writing.

Over the years, she started doing more of her own writing, but she notably never wrote about Gram again on this level, until "The Road". So there are several motifs and specific word choices present in both songs, which tie the two together at the lyrical and lexical levels, and in translation, must be acknowledged, and the connection should be maintained. For example:

-wilderness
-coming down from the mountain

However, "coming down from the mountain" is a longstanding country western - bluegrass - Scots traditional ballad trope, and has meaning of its own.

And immediately *on the heels* of that, we have "walking in your shoes"; there are Biblical references, "To everything there is a season", which also echoes the Byrds' cover of "Turn, Turn, Turn"; after all, Gram himself was tightly tied to the Byrds. As tight as he could be tied to anything.

So: Getting the translation of this *right*, in addition to Emmylou's difficult syllabic structure and, IIRC, shifting rhyme scheme, is challenging.
