At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong

You and me
At the dark end
Of the street
You and me

I know time is gonna take its toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin, and we know it's wrong
Oh, but our love keeps coming on strong

We'll steal away
To the dark end
Of the street

They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us, someday

You and me
At the dark end
Of the street
You and me

And when the daylight hours roll 'round
And by chance we're both downtown
If we should meet, just walk on by
Oh, darling, please, don't cry

Tonight, we'll meet
At the dark end
Of the street
