Tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested, though in the wrong

Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

When death has come and taken our loved ones
Leaving our home so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder how others prosper
Living so wicked year after year

Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by

# Commentary:  
Reading this in January 2026, I'm not sure this song, of all the Byrds' oeuvre, belongs here, especially as, IIRC, it's not actually by the Byrds; I believe it's a traditional hymn. Which... I know why I included it here. Because of its resonance with the horizon, the future, the other side. 

I suppose this is "un caso limitrofe", pun 110% intended.
