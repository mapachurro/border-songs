# Border Songs

This repository is a book of poetry. I'm not kidding, that's not a metaphor, that's literally what I'm doing here.

This is a long-standing project in my head. I had the privilege of participating in [Kernel](https://www.kernel.community) Block X, and I took advantage of that framework to finally rip off the band-aid, *tira*ndome a la piscina.

There is a theme that is threaded through popular music, a very old theme in fact, which I find becomes much clearer in translation. When I've worked on this enough to explain it succinctly, I'll update this. Maybe. Or you'll have to read the book, idk, *but*:

## What is wrong with you, why is nodejs involved

Because I'm incorrigible? Maybe, but also because I have an idea about how I want this text to be visually represented, and stored (IMMUTABLY !!!1!1), and iterated upon (MERKLE TRIES!!1!!), and therefore, the medium with which I will be binding this book will be JAVASCRIPT.

# Full track listing

There's a structure and organization to this work which follows the logic of the theme itself. This is recursive, deconstructive logic, take it or leave it. Each section in the [binder](./binder/) will have an individual track listing inside it, `track-list-{number}.md`.
